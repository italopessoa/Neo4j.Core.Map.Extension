### What is Neo4j.Map.Extension?
Neo4j.Map.Extension is a simple tool that was born from an experiment while I was learning how to use Neo4j.Driver to execute queries in Neo4j. After some repetitive query parses, I tried to make it more abstract for me, using some attributes to configure a graph node as a custom C# class.

#### Package Manager
`PM> Install-Package Neo4j.Map.Extension`
